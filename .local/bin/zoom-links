## A script that modifies Zoom links for the use in browsers, opens it then in a private chromium
##   window and puts the password into the clipboard. If no argument is given the link is taken out
##   of the clipboard.
## The reason behind the choice of Chromium is that my Firefox does weird things when used in
##   scripts and that I wanted to run Zoom separately from my normal Firefox instances.
##   (although this should be solvable by separate Firefox profiles.)

# Check if necessary commands exist
command -v firefox >/dev/null 2>&1 || return 1
command -v xclip >/dev/null 2>&1 || return 1

# If no argument is given, set the clipboard as argument
[ $# -gt 0 ] || set "$(xclip -selection c -o)"
# Check for right format
echo "$1" | grep -Eq "^https://tu-berlin.zoom.us/(j|wc/join)/[0-9]*\?pwd=.+" || return 1

# Make link work for browser joining
link="$(echo "${1%?pwd=*}" | sed 's_/j/_/wc/join/_')"
# Open link in private browser
firefox --no-remote -P zoom --private-window "$link" >/dev/null 2>&1 &
# Put password in clipboard
echo -n "${1##*pwd=}" | xclip -selection c
