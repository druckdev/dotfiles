This also reverts commit 0ca1baec8c3ad58de8b88851cc8f981a28db3f5c
(vim:ftplugin:c: Exclude `-` from 'iskeyword', 2023-05-21).

The reason behind adding the dash to `&iskeyword` was probably that it
can be part of command names in shell scripts. The future commit
688f8e18aabb (vim:ftplug:shell*: Add `-` to `&iskeyword`, 2025-08-06)
brings this change back, but only in the shell* ftplugins.
