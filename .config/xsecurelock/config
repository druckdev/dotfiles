# specifies the time (in seconds) before telling X11 to fully blank the screen; a negative value
# disables X11 blanking. The time is measured since the closing of the auth window or xsecurelock
# startup. Setting this to 0 is rather nonsensical, as key-release events (e.g. from the keystroke
# to launch xsecurelock or from pressing escape to close the auth dialog) always wake up the screen.

# create a second full-screen window to obscure window content in case a running compositor unmaps
# its own window. Helps with some instances of bad compositor behavior (such as compositor crashes/
# restarts, but also compton has been caught at drawing notification icons above the screen locker
# when not using the GLX backend), should prevent compositors from unredirecting as it's 1 pixel
# smaller than the screen from every side, and should otherwise be harmless, so it's enabled by
# default.

# time_ shows the current time since the epoch on each keystroke. This may be the most secure mode,
# as it gives feedback to keystroke based exclusively on public information, and does not carry
# over any state between keystrokes whatsoever - not even some form of randomness.
