# feh theme configuration file (see feh(1))
#
# > .config/feh/themes allows the naming of option groups, called themes. It
# > takes entries of the form "<theme> <options>...", where <theme> is the name
# > of the entry and <options> are the options which will be applied when the
# > theme is used.
#
# Themes can be be passed with the `-T, --theme` flag or set via the program
# name (e.g. with symlinks). By default feh will look for a "feh" theme.
